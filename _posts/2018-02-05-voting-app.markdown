Recently I finished a first version of a voting app for the Free Code Camp backend projects.

There is much to improve. But first I have to learn more and then I will go back to that project and make it better if I can.

It would be nice to get some (in good faith, non offensive) feedback.

It's at [https://votapp.glitch.me](https://votapp.glitch.me) and the github repo is [https://zdflower.github.io/votapp](https://zdflower.github.io/votapp)

It's in spanish, the view and comments on the code, and most of the names of functions and variables. But if you speak english and want to practice spanish, or if you speak spanish and english, and want to help me keep learning, be welcome.
