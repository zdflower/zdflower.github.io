# Hunting bugs and polishing things
There are bugs in my Simon game. So it's hunting season :-). I've already cought some, but so far remains one in particular. It has effect when you make a mistake clicking the wrong buttons for a sequence.

Also I am currently updating [my portfolio page](https://codepen.io/zdflower/full/mWEpoz), and reviewing code, removing clutter from all the projects. The task is not complete but I've started and will get to it.
