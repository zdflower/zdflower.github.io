Yesterday, I was lost, but today I am not :-)
Sometimes you have to let things go ..., i.e. let the api go...
I change the api from what the code gets the location, and it works! I want to cry out loud!!!
There's a lot to improve, but the minimum works, so, from that I can keep making it better (and the way I'm constructing sentences in english too, I imagine).
Today the sun shines without clouds! :-)
Let's code again!
