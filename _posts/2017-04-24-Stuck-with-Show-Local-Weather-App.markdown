It's almost done, but...
It works locally, but not on codepen nor on githubpages. It has "something" to do with http-https mixed access to the apis that used http and codepen and github that apparently require https.
So, I'm stuck until I learn how to fix that, and first of all what is the problem, why is that a problem, etc. The first thing to solve a problem is understand it.
