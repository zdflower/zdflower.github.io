## Retrieving data from the api

I add a property on the state of the page to store the list of campers.
Then I use fetch to get the data and then set the state with it.
Finally I passed it to the Table and to the Filas.

### User stories

Here are the user stories from [https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard)

- [x] I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- [x] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- [x] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
