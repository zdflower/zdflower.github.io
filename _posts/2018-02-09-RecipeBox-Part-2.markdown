## What's new

Well, I made a basic static page that renders a list of recipes, with names and ingredients. The recipes come from a list of objects with the structure: {name: String, ingredients: Array of Strings}.

In spite of having said that I would leave style for later, I added some simple style. I used sass (variables, nesting), I've just started to learn it.

## User stories:
