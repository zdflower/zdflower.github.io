Yesterday I finished the project. There is a lot to improve, as always, but that won't take me the joy of what I have accomplished for now.

To get the urls I took the titles of the pages, split the strings by the spaces and join the array with low dashes, and append that at the end of https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/

There would be nice if in addition to clicking a button you can also press the enter key to trigger the search. I have that pending.
