It's still not finished yet, but now I know something more than yesterday. 
With fixed latitude and longitude (avoiding the use of an api to get the location) then the rest works fine.
So, I conclude, there is a problem getting the location data. Brilliant, I know.
I'm getting there :-)
Just need to keep going!
