# I've got the Frontend Certificate!
Last weekend I submitted the Simon Game project ang got the certificate.
Since then I am reviewing some of the projects, specially the portfolio.
The plan is to improve all of them. It would be great to get some feedback that could help me with this task. I should post a message on the fcc forum.

# What next?
There are other projects and courses. For example the visual certificate path and the backend path, but I need to learn more about the tools used there in order to tackle those projects.

Also I am learning from the CS50-edx course, currently on the problem set of week 2.

And another thing that I would like to mention is a wonderful course on [Effective thinking through mathematics](https://www.edx.org/course/effective-thinking-through-mathematics-utaustinx-ut-9-01x-0), it is just great, enlightning, inspiring, necessary.
