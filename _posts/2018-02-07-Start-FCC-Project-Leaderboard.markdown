title: Starting the Leaderboard FreeCodeCamp project
---

After finishing the Voting app I wanted to learn more about front end and go back to learn some react, review css, etc.

Today I am starting the project. 

Here are the user stories from [https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard)

[ ] I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
[ ] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
[ ] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

So far I watched the video zipline, made a sketch of the layout, thinked about the components and the functionality of toggling the order of the campers by last 30 days points or by total points.

I am thinking of dividing the problem in parts and explore them one by one and then use the gained knowledge to build the final solution.

For example, before getting the info from the apis in the page, I downloaded the data and will leave dealing with the apis for another time and will focus first on how to toggle between the different orders of the lists.
