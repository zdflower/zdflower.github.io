That's enough. There is no point in trying to make that work. I'll leave it to the future me, whom may have more wisdom.
I have to let this thing go and find something else that I can tackle and learn from and make some progress, because with this awful thing I can't be more miserable. It is affecting my learning of other interesting and useful things.
All this makes me think about these moments in life..., makes me wonder when it is better to let something go or stay obsessed, stuck, blinded, loosing time. This project was a good thing at the beginning but at this point is just awful and painful. May be, in the future, with fresh eyes and mind, I could try again. But for now, for my own sake, it is best to leave it as it is.
