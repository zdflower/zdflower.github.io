title: Recipe Box - FCC Challenge - Part 1

Today I begin with the Recipe Box challenge. It will be great for learning about local storage and user interface.

These are the user stories:

- [ ] I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
- [ ] I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
- [ ] I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
- [ ] I can edit these recipes.
- [ ] I can delete these recipes.
- [ ] All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

## First thoughts

* Leave local storage, style, editing and deleting a recipe for later.
* It seems that the demo page used bootstrap.
* I am interested in getting that effect of clicking the name of the recipe and show the ingredients.
* Start with an existing example recipe like {name: "Cookies", ingredients: "Flour, butter, sugar, vanilla, baking powder"}.
* Divide the page into a hierarchy of components.

## Future readings

* [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
* HTML5 - [Storage](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage)
