## React

I am having __trouble__ with changing the data when the user clicks the column's headers for recent points and for all time points (the third user story).

I have to think about it a little more and learn more about React.

That is the plan so far.


## Style

There is some style added.

I am starting to learn _Sass_.


### User stories

Here are the user stories from [https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard)

- [x] I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- [x] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- [ ] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
