## What's new

I have a version that works and fulfills the user stories (kind of, if you look at editing recipes). But I am not totally pleased. I wanted to divide the page into components, and have general components that can be specialized, but all became such a mess and couldn't make it work at all when attacking the editing problem.

So I decided to go back a lot and render allmost all from the Page component. Works.

## Things to improve

Learn React, be more aquainted with it. So far there is no much feeling between us, may be I had to put more of my self into this relation with React, pay more attention, try to understand more, be patient :-)

Also I would like to know how to make the edition of recipes really like editing a file, where you don't have to write it all over if you want to change something.

## User stories:
