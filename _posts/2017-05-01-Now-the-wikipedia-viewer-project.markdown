title:  "Now the Wikipedia viewer project"

This week I begin with the Wikipedia viewer project. So far I built the html structure and a basic jquery script to test how some things work (or not), before the (maybe not) nightmare of dealing with the Wikipedia API.
I have learned a little about how to manage a keyboard event in jquery, because I wanted to initiate the search with the press of the enter key or clicking the button.
Also some bootstrap, like the "page-header" class, or that you can have a well or a well-sm among other sizes.
Also I needed to review how to use forms.
