title: Beginning to learn React
---

After completed the projects and challenges of the Front End path of FreeCodeCamp I've been reviewing those projects. For example, the portfolio needed an update, and other projects as well. Besides that I wanted to keep moving, so I did the [Markdown previewer](https://codepen.io/zdflower/full/awMVOm) but without using React nor Sass. 
But I plan to re-make it when I learn enough of both resources.
Currently I found the following materials to learn from:

* [Free Code Camp React Challenge Alpha](http://hysterical-amusement.surge.sh/)
* [Intro to React - Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
* [The NetNinja React Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i0_2FF-WhtRIfIJ1lXlTZR)
